      Service.create({name: 'Dog Walking', featured: true, cost: 5, description: "Humans and dogs share similar social needs; we live with others and enjoy social interaction. Staying inside for long periods of time without contact decreases their sense of normality, even when surrounded by other pets. The energy they accumulate during the day may cause behavior problems such as: chewing (furniture or themselves), jumping on you and visitors as soon as they enter the door, excessive barking, uncontrolled body functions, and depression. Our program is great for owners who wish to eliminate their dogâ€™s extra energy and weight that builds up during the day. We practice positive reinforcement training and we will partner with you to implement a plan that will set your dog up to be successful in their training. Our regular, midday visits are 25-minutes in length."});
